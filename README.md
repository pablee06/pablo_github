# Welcome to Pablo's First Spacegame ü¶á

This is Pablo's first awesome Spacegame.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

First you need to install Python:

```sh
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version for your operating system
```

Since this game is based an "pygames" you need to install the pygames library. To do so open a terminal within your IDE and type

```sh
pip install pygame
```

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pablee06/pablo_github.git
```

## Usage ‚ÑπÔ∏è

To start playing go to the root of your folder and run this command

```sh
python spacegame.ty
```

Within the game just use the 'ARROW KEYS' of your keyboard to fly around the screen.
Try to survice as long as possible to crack the highscore.

To exit the game press 'ESC' on your kyboard.

Have fun!
